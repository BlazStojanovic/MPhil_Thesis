\begin{acknowledgements}      
First of all, I would like to thank Zala for her love, support, and for helping me get through the roughest parts of my MPhil journey. I would also like to thank my family: grandparents for their words of wisdom, parents for showing nothing but support for my ambitions, and brother for being the most reliable friend. 

Secondly, I would like to acknowledge everyone that helped make studying at Cambridge a reality for me. My primary and secondary school teachers who inspired me, as well as the faculty at FMF for providing the foundation of my education. I am most grateful to dr. Kosec for allowing me to work with him and for everything I learned from him and dr. Slak at IJS.  I want to thank dr. Kosec and prof. Prosen, for believing in me and writing my recommendation letters. 

Finally, I thank prof. Austen Lamacraft, not just for his supervision, guidance, and advice, but for all the coffees and discussions of Physics at St. Johns, which were exactly how I imagined Cambridge would be.
